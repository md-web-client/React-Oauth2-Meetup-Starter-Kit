# Meetup Oauth2 React Redux Starter Application.

1) Big thanks to [epoch meup](https://github.com/epoch/meup). The oauth stuff was implemented from that project.

2) Upgrade the project to add React Router and React Loadable to make the codebase simpler.
<br/>The results of the requests have also been simplified to remove complexity.

3) If you need to see a post request, checkout "rsvp auto subscribe app".
<br/>Works off of this base application and adds a few goodies. 😉
